# engine
Game engine I am writing in pure c as of now it is just a collection of core systems I have yet to put it all toghter.

## Design Requirements
* Composition over OOP
* All heap memory is preallocated i.e no allocations (malloc calls) during gameplay
* 2d
* Cross platform (OSX, Win32, Linux) 
* Hardware rendering

## Planned Features
* live code reloading
* component system

## Libraries Used/Planning to Use
* SDL2 
* OpenGL
* Lua
